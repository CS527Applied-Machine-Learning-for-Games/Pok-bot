## Winning Predictor Model : 

To supplement our Deep Q-Learning Agent while battling, the strength of each side during a battle can be evaluated using the winning percentage at a point in time. We utilized the data we scraped from thousands of replays to create data consisting of features we deemed as important in determining which player would win.

We used the file completed.csv from the google drive link - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tu7qDDw8NLILY4DnVYujWGTD0fcOlu4a was used for prediction. 

The classifiers used for prediction are : 

Dummy Classifier 

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes Classifier

XGB Classifier

Neural Network

Decision Tree 

Random Forest Classifier
