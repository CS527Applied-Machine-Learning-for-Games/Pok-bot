## Winning Predictor Model

To supplement our Deep Q-Learning Agent while battling, the strength of each side during a battle can be evaluated using the winning percentage at a point in time. We utilized the data we scraped from thousands of replays to create data consisting of features we deemed as important in determining which player would win.

The file completed.csv from this google drive link - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1tu7qDDw8NLILY4DnVYujWGTD0fcOlu4a was used for prediction. 

The classifiers used for prediction are : 

1. Dummy Classifier 

2. Logistic Regression

3. Naive Bayes Classifier

4. XGB Classifier

5. Neural Network

6. Decision Tree 

7. Random Forest Classifier
